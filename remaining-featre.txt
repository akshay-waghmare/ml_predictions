# Project Requirement Analysis for Predictive Cricket Betting App

After reviewing the project requirements document, here's what we would need to implement to achieve the goals of the Predictive Cricket Betting App:

## 1. Data Collection & Processing (Partially Implemented)
- ✅ Ball-by-ball cricket data scraping (implemented in espnscraper_ballbyball.py)
- ✅ Player stats collection (implemented in batting_stats.py)
- ✅ Basic data merging and cleaning (implemented in data_merger.py)
- ❌ Need more advanced real-time data integration (odds feeds, weather data)

## 2. Feature Engineering Requirements
- ❌ Create derived metrics like:
  - Momentum indicators (runs in last X overs)
  - Pressure indicators (required run rate vs. current run rate)
  - Player form metrics (recent performance vs. career average)
- ❌ Implement lag-based features (time since last wicket, boundaries)
- ❌ Calculate rolling averages for key statistics

## 3. Machine Learning Models
- ❌ Binary classification model for initial LAY bet identification
- ❌ Multi-label classification for odds movement prediction
- ❌ Feature importance analysis to understand key factors
- ❌ Probability calibration using Platt Scaling or Isotonic Regression

## 4. Betting Logic
- ❌ Implement Kelly Criterion for stake sizing
- ❌ Design logic for identifying favorable LAY scenarios
- ❌ Create a system for tracking odds movements during matches

## 5. Infrastructure & Deployment
- ❌ Build API endpoints for real-time prediction service
- ❌ Create Docker containers for reproducible deployment
- ❌ Implement database for storing predictions and results
- ❌ Set up monitoring and logging

## 6. Evaluation System
- ❌ Create backtesting framework
- ❌ Implement metrics tracking (ROC-AUC, F1-Score, Precision/Recall)
- ❌ Calculate betting ROI as business performance metric

## Key Next Steps:
1. Expand feature engineering beyond basic stats
2. Build a labeled dataset with betting outcomes
3. Train initial models for LAY betting identification
4. Implement real-time prediction API
5. Design and implement the stake management system

Currently, you have a good foundation for data collection, but the project needs significant work on modeling, prediction, and the betting strategy implementation to achieve the goals outlined in the requirements document.
