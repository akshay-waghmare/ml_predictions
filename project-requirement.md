# **Predictive Cricket Betting App - Goals & Requirements Document**

## **1. Project Overview**
The Predictive Cricket Betting App aims to provide real-time betting insights by analyzing historical and live match data. The system identifies favorable **LAY betting opportunities**, estimates odds movement probabilities, and optimizes stake management based on predictions.

## **2. Key Requirements**

### **2.1 Initial LAY Bet Identification**
- Automatically recognize favorable **LAY** betting scenarios using **bias detection** (e.g., favoritism, longshot).
- **Prediction Goal:** A **binary classification model** that predicts whether laying a bet is favorable.

### **2.2 Odds Movement Probability Estimation**
- Predict the probability of odds moving from an initial level (e.g., **1.2 to 1.5, 1.7, or 2.0**).
- **Prediction Goal:** A **multi-label classification model** to predict odds movements.

### **2.3 Historical and Real-Time Data Utilization**
- Integrate **historical match data**, player performances, and venue-specific statistics.
- Incorporate **real-time** data, including **live scores, odds fluctuations, wickets, boundaries, and weather conditions**.

### **2.4 Feature Engineering**
- **Derived Metrics:** Rolling averages, momentum indicators, and pressure indicators.
- **Lag-Based Features:** Time since last wicket, recent scoring trends, and odds movement indicators.

### **2.5 Model Performance Optimization**
- Evaluate models using **ROC-AUC, F1-Score, Precision, Recall, and Return on Investment (ROI)**.
- Use **Platt Scaling** or **Isotonic Regression** for probability calibration and stake recommendations.

### **2.6 Stake Management**
- Implement **Kelly Criterion** to optimize stake sizes based on predicted probabilities and user bankroll.

### **2.7 Scalability & Deployment**
- Serve models via **APIs** for real-time predictions.
- Ensure **scalability** for growing user bases and increasing data volumes using **Docker/Kubernetes**.

### **2.8 Continuous Improvement**
- Periodically **retrain models** using new match data.
- Integrate **user feedback** to refine betting recommendations.

## **3. Suggested Workflow**
### **3.1 Data Preparation**
- Scrape or fetch **historical and real-time** match data.
- Store data in **structured formats** (CSV, PostgreSQL).

### **3.2 Feature Engineering**
- Compute **rolling averages** (runs, wickets, strike rate).
- Generate **lag-based features** (time since last boundary, run rate trends).

### **3.3 Model Selection**
- Start with **Logistic Regression** for LAY bet identification.
- Use **XGBoost or LSTMs** for odds movement prediction.

### **3.4 Hyperparameter Tuning**
- Optimize models using **GridSearchCV** or **Optuna**.

### **3.5 Probability Calibration**
- Apply **Platt Scaling** or **Isotonic Regression**.

### **3.6 Stake Management**
- Implement **Kelly Criterion** for stake sizing.

### **3.7 Deployment**
- Serve models using **Flask** or **FastAPI**.
- Plan for **Docker/Kubernetes** to scale the system.

## **4. Data Output Example**
The system generates outputs like:
```json
{
  "over_details": "Over 12 â€¢ CSK 88/2",
  "live_forecasts": ["CSK needed 75 runs from 48 balls"],
  "win_probabilities": ["CSK 56.85%"]
}
```
---

## **5. Data Collection (Scraping)**
- **Scripts Used:**
  - `espnscraper.py`: Fetches team details, player stats, and venue statistics.
  - `espnscraper_ballbyball.py`: Extracts **ball-by-ball** commentary and key player performance details.

---

## **6. Next Steps**
1. **Optimize scraping scripts** to handle multiple IPL matches.
2. **Refine the prediction model** with better feature engineering.
3. **Deploy API services** for real-time match predictions.
4. **Improve user experience** with betting recommendations.
